## Introduction
In the age of AI, developers can significantly enhance their productivity by using AI tools to generate, optimize, and debug scripts. This repository aims to serve as a central hub for storing and sharing prompts that can be used with AI tools to develop scripts in Bash, Python, and AppleScript, which are the most frequest uses for me. I may expand this at some point,

## Usage
To use this repository, simply browse through the collection of prompts and hints provided for each scripting language. You can copy and modify these prompts to suit your specific needs. The prompts are designed to help you:
- Generate new scripts
- Optimize existing scripts
- Debug and troubleshoot scripts
- Automate repetitive tasks
